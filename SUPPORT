Getting Help
---

The SourceForge project page (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fakenes)
offers a tracker where you can submit and view bug reports, feature
requests, support requests, and patches.  There you will also find the
very low-traffic fakenes-bugs mailing list.

In addition, there is an IRC channel (#silohware/fakenes) on Freenode
dedicated to the continuing development of FakeNES.
