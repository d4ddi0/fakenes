   Getting Support
  =================

    The SourceForge project page for FakeNES offers a tracker where
    you can submit and view bug reports, feature requests, support
    requests, and patches.  There you will also find the low-traffic
    fakenes-bugs mailing list.

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fakenes/

    In addition, there is an IRC channel (#fakenes) dedicated to the
    continuing development of FakeNES on irc.freenode.net
