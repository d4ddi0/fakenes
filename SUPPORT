   Getting Support
  =================

    The SourceForge project page for FakeNES offers a tracker where
    you can submit and view bug reports, feature requests, support
    requests, and patches.

    You will also find the FakeNES open discussion forum, which is
    a periodically moderated public forum, under 'Forums', as well
    as the low-traffic fakenes-bugs mailing list, under 'Lists'.

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/fakenes/

    In addition, there is an IRC channel dedicated to the continuing
    development of FakeNES on the open projects network (OPN).

    #fakenes on irc.openprojects.net (xchat is recommended).
