readme.txt for HawkThreads


HawkThreads is the portable thread library originally developed for use in HawkNL. It has been
'broken out' as a separate project in order to more easily be used ion other projects.

To use simply include the source files along with your project. On Linux, BSD, or UNIX systems
be sure to link to your pthreads library, and on Windows compile as multithreaded.
