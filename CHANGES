Version 0.2.0
====--

Miscellaneous changes:
  Added fast zero-page memory access to CPU emulation.
  Eliminated some obsolete return values in CPU emulation.

  Fixed a serious bug in video mode initialization.

Video output changes:
  Added the ability to specify blit region, to hide vertical scrolling.
  Added a toggle to the Options > Video menu in the GUI for 'force_window'.
  Added 2xSCL blitter (similar to 2xSOE, only better and slower).
  Improved the overall performance of basic blitting routines.

PPU rendering changes:
  Moved checks for sprites/background enabled outside of drawing loops.
  Altered cache-preloading in display rendering.

Memory mapper support changes:
