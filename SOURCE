   Building FakeNES
  ==================

    For the moment, the FakeNES source code is fairly easy to compile,
    assuming that you have the proper tools to do so.

    The FakeNES developers make no promises to whether or not you will
    be able build or run any of this software on your system.


  =============
   DOS Version
  =============

    With the following tools I can build the complete DOS version of
    FakeNES, I hope that it will also work for you.

    - DJGPP v2 or higher.  As of this writing I am using DJGPP v2 with
      GCC version 3.02.  Just go to 'http://www.delorie.com/djgpp' and
      click on the 'Zip Picker' link.  The default options are fine as
      long as you also select 'C++' and 'Assembler' under languages.
      
      If you plan on doing a 'make clean' then you will also need to
      get the GNU fileutils package, available on your nearest DJGPP
      mirror under the directory 'v2gnu'.

    - Allegro version 3.9.34 or higher.  I recommend using at least
      version 3.9.39.  As of this writing, I am using the latest,
      version 3.9.40, which does not compile with GCC version 3.02.
      I do not recommend using the pre-built development binaries,
      you should build Allegro yourself to avoid problems.

      The Allegro homepage is at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/.

      You can get a preliminary build of GCC version 3.03 for DJGPP
      that will compile Allegro version 3.9.xx from this page:

      http://www.ltn.lv/~pavenis/gcctest.html

   Once everything is installed and built, switch to the 'src' child
   directory and execute 'make -f build/makefile.djgpp'.


  =================
   Windows Version 
  =================

    With the following tools I can build the complete Windows version
    of FakeNES designed to run with the Microsoft DirectX 7.x runtime.

    - Mingw32 version 1.0.1 or higher.  As of this writing I am using
      version 1.1.  Just go to 'http://www.mingw.org' and get the
      single distrobution archive and you will have everything you
      need.  It is quite large, you should use a download manager when
      downloading it.

      If you plan on doing a 'make clean' then you will also need to
      get the GNU fileutils package, you can get it from DJGPP (read
      above) or Cygwin, which is what I use.

      You will need to place the path to the GNU fileutils binaries
      __after__ Mingw32 in your 'PATH' environment variable.

    - Allegro version 3.9.34 or higher.  I recommend using at least
      version 3.9.39.  As of this writing, I am using version 3.9.40.
      I do not recommend using the pre-built development binaries,
      you should build Allegro yourself to avoid problems.

      The Allegro homepage is at http://alleg.sourceforge.net/.

      NOTICE: The FakeNES developers will not support the DirectX 8.x
      runtime at this time except through backwards compatibility with
      the DirectX 7.x runtime.  The DirectX 8.x runtime removes all
      support for non-Pentium systems.

      Due to the nature of the FakeNES license, you are free to build
      the Windows version of FakeNES yourself and link it against the
      DirectX 8.x libraries, and distribute such copies freely.

   Once everything is installed and built, switch to the 'src' child
   directory and execute 'make -f build/makefile.mingw32'.
