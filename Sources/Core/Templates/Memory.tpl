/* Note:
   Each read or write takes a single clock to complete, including stack access.
   Because of this, a word (16-bit) read or write takes two clocks to complete.

   During these times, the CPU can also perform a limited amount of other tasks,
   such as incrementing the program counter, or stack pointer. So these do not affect
   the clock counter directly, only by the memory access that occur on the same clock.
 
   For synchronization with other system components to work properly (the APU and PPU),
   the clock counter *must* be incremented after every operation, as external devices
   perform "catch up" on their state at the exact moment of any read or write to
   their address space. For example, if performing a 16-bit read, the clock counter
   must be incremented after each individual byte read. */
