/* The INLINE macro insists that a function be inlined, but does not require it.
   It is ultimately the decision of the compiler to do so.

   The FORCE_INLINE macro forces a function to always be inlined whenever possible.

   The EXTERN_INLINE usualy resolves to extern inline. This isn't supported by every
   compiler or standard so it may not be defined to anything. It provides external
   linkage to inline functions, even if they would normally be static. This can be used,
   for example, to pass an inline function as a template argument.

   The EXCLUSIVE macro is used for when a function is only ever called once. It is
   guaranteed to always be inlined into its parent whenever possible. It is
   functionally identical to FORCE_INLINE, but helps with hand-optimizations.

   The EXPRESS macro serves as a shortcut for a micro-function that must run as
   fast as possible. It is also always implicitly static. This should not be used
   for large functions, or functions with more than a few arguments. If speed is not
   terribly critical, FORCE_INLINE should be used instead.

   The LINEAR_FUNCTION macro defines a function as being entirely flat; all of the
   functions within it will be inlined if possible. The function itself will not
   always be inlined unless explicitly requested.

   The KERNEL_FUNCTION macro tells the compiler that a function is called frequently,
   allowing it to be better optimized. Kernelled functions should not be inlined, as it
   counteracts cache optimizations. Generally, which functions are suitable for
   kernelling will be determined by a profiler. */
