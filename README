    =================
     Input Interface
    =================

      Current FakeNES supports up to 4 players (only used in a select
      few games such as Gauntlet 2) via both the keyboard and/or
      a maximum of two joypads or other joystick-like devices.

      The input device for each player is mappable separately but
      an input device is not unique to that player.  For example,
      keyboard layout #1 can be assigned to both players #1 and #2
      without conflicts.

      You can select the input device for each player in the FakeNES
      configuration file under the "player_x_device" items (where 'x'
      is the player #).  The following values are currently supported:

      0: No input (disables ALL input for this player).

      1: Keyboard layout #1
      2: Keyboard layout #2

        The keyboard layouts are defined by supplying a sequence of
        8 integer scancodes separated by spaces in the "[input]"
        section via the "key1_scancodes" and "key2_scancodes" items.
        The order is A, B, Select, Start, Up, Down, Left, and Right.

        If these items are not found, or are corrupt, then FakeNES
        will use the built in defaults of X, Z, Tab, Enter, Up, Down
        Left, and Right, respectively, for keyboard layout #1, and
        number pad 1, 3, 7, 9, 8, 2, 4, 6, respectively, for keyboard
        layout #2.

      3: Joystick device #1
      4: Joystick device #2

        The joystick devices support mapping of 2 (A, B) or 4 (A, B,
        Select, Start) buttons to the input interface, but you can
        only use 4 buttons if your platform supports it.  FakeNES
        will automatically detect this, and enable them if available.

        Therefor, it is recommended that you preserve A and B as the
        first 2 buttons (on the NES, the order would be B, A, though).
        If no more than 2 buttons are available, then keyboard layout #1
        (for joystick device #1) and keyboard layout #2 (for joystick
        device #2) will be used to handle Select and Start buttons.

        The joystick button mappings are defined by supplying a
        sequence of integer button #s (up to 10) separated by spaces in
        the "[input]" section via the "joy1_buttons" and "joy2_buttons"
        items.  Please refer to your joystick device manual for
        information about button #s and where each button is located
        on your joypad or joystick-like device.  The order is A, B,
        Select, Start.

        If these items are not found, or are corrupt, then FakeNES
        will use the built in defaults of 1, 0, 2, and 3, respectively,
        for both joystick devices.
